<p>I'm in love with Jesus Christ
<br>He's so nice
<br>I'm in love, I'll say it twice
<br>I'm in love (I'm in love)
<br>I'm in love but I'm feeling low
<br>For I am just a footprint in the snow
<br>I'm in love with a boy I know
<br>But that's a feeling I can never show
<br>
<br>Fortunately I believe
<br>Lucky me
<br>I'm searching for planes in the sea
<br>And that's irony
<br>Soil just needs water to be
<br>And the seed
<br>So if we turn into a tree
<br>Can I be the leaves?
<br>
<br>I'm in love with the girl next door
<br>Her name's Claire
<br>Nice when she comes round to call
<br>Then masturbate the second she's not there
<br><br>Fortunately I believe
<br>Lucky me
<br>I'm searching for planes in the sea
<br>And that's irony
<br>Soil just needs water to be
<br>And the seed
<br>So if we turn into a tree
<br>Can I be the leaves?</p>
